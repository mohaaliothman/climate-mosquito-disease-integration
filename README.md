# Climate–Mosquito–Disease Analytics

## Project Description
This project integrates and analyzes multiple global datasets to explore the relationships between **climate conditions**, **mosquito occurrence**, and **vector-borne disease trends**.  
It combines temperature, precipitation, mosquito observation records, and disease incidence/death data into a unified analytical framework.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Data integration from multiple sources  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Correlation analysis  
- Predictive modeling  
- Interactive dashboard visualization  

---

##  Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

- To analyze how **temperature and precipitation** vary across countries and years  
- To examine patterns in **mosquito occurrence records**  
- To study trends in **vector-borne diseases** such as Dengue, Malaria, Yellow fever, and Zika  
- To integrate climate and health data into a single dataset  
- To explore potential relationships between:
  - Climate conditions  
  - Mosquito populations  
  - Disease case counts  
- To visualize insights using an interactive dashboard  

---

##  Key Research Questions

1. How do global temperature and precipitation trends change over time?  
2. Are mosquito population records associated with climate variables?  
3. Do changes in temperature or precipitation relate to disease incidence?  
4. Can mosquito presence and climate features help predict disease risk?  
5. Which countries and regions show the highest disease burdens?

##  Data Sources

This project integrates the following datasets:

- Monthly average surface temperature data  
- Annual precipitation data  
- Disease incidence and death statistics  
- Mosquito occurrence records from GBIF  

All datasets are cleaned, standardized, and merged using ISO country codes and time information.
